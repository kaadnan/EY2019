EY Data Science Challenge 2019

The task is to predict how many people are in the city center between 15:00 and 16:00. A set of trajectories for individual devices are given for 11 days. The test dataset contains a number of devices where the trajectories after 15:00 have been removed. All but one: After 15:00, we can find one last trajectory, with (1) entry location, (2) entry time and an exit time that is between 15:00 and 16:00. But the exit point has been removed. The task is to predict the location of this last exit point and whether this device is within the city center or not
